%% These are the start functions used to create and
%% initialize the server.

%% REVIEWER: I find the instructions are a little confusing.  We're do
%% submit frequency.erl?  But frequency2.erl is the support file?
%% Except, the original module name was just 'frequency', which is an
%% error?  I decided that they must want us just to modify this file,
%% independent of the work we did in the previous exercise.  The
%% simplest way for me to do that was just to put all modifications in
%% this file, but change its module to 'frequency2'.  Consequently,
%% the register expression below has to change a bit.

start() ->
    register(frequency,
	     spawn(frequency2, init, [])).

init() ->
    Frequencies = {get_frequencies(), []},
    loop(Frequencies).

% Hard Coded
get_frequencies() -> [10,11,12,13,14,15].

%% The Main Loop

loop(Frequencies) ->
    receive
	{request, Pid, allocate} ->
	    {NewFrequencies, Reply} = allocate(Frequencies, Pid),
	    Pid ! {reply, Reply},
	    loop(NewFrequencies);
	{request, Pid , {deallocate, Freq}} ->
	    NewFrequencies = deallocate(Frequencies, Freq),
	    Pid ! {reply, ok},
	    loop(NewFrequencies);
	{request, Pid, stop} ->
	    Pid ! {reply, stopped};
	{request, Pid, {sleep,N}} ->
	    Pid ! {reply, sleeping},
	    sleep(N),
	    loop(Frequencies);
	{request, Pid, clear} ->		%REVIEWER: New protocol handler for 'clear'
	    clear(),				%Use help function.  Remind me why we're not just using 'flush'?
	    Pid ! {reply, ok},			%Say 'ok' back to client.  All clear!
	    loop(Frequencies);			%Loop again, with state unchanged.
	{request, Pid, {echo,Msg}} ->		%REVIEWER: New protocol handler for 'echo'
	    Pid ! echo(Msg),			%Use help function.  (we're being a bit pedantic here)
	    loop(Frequencies)			%Loop again, with state unchanged.
    end.

allocate() ->

    frequency ! {request, self(), allocate},
    receive 
	{reply, Reply} -> Reply
    after 1000 -> 
	    {error,timedout}
    end.

deallocate(Freq) -> 
    frequency ! {request, self(), {deallocate, Freq}},

    end.

stop() -> 
    frequency ! {request, self(), stop},

    end.

%% REVIEWER: Added a functional API call to send a message to the
%% server to ask it to sleep for awhile.  Note that we don't wait for
%% a reply because that would put US to sleep, too!

sleepserver(N) ->
    frequency ! {request, self(), {sleep, N}}.

%% REVIEWER: Added a spam functional API call to send arbitrary
%% messages.  The point is that these won't be handled and so will
%% just sit in the mailbox, which gives us something to clear.  No
%% reason the client should be the only one to experience all the
%% "clearing" fun, right?

spam(Msg) ->
    frequency ! {request, self(), Msg},
    ok.

%% REVIEWER: Added a clear function to the functional API.

clearserver() ->
    frequency ! {request, self(), clear},
    receive
	{reply, Reply} ->
	    Reply
    end.

%% REVIEWER: Heck, we might as well support clearing the client
%% process as well.

clearclient() ->
    clear().

%% INTERNAL HELP FUNCTIONS

%% The Internal Help Functions used to allocate and
%% deallocate frequencies.

allocate({[], Allocated}, _Pid) ->
    {{[], Allocated}, {error, no_frequency}};
allocate({[Freq|Free], Allocated}, Pid) ->
    {{Free, [{Freq, Pid}|Allocated]}, {ok, Freq}}.

deallocate({Free, Allocated}, Freq) ->
    NewAllocated=lists:keydelete(Freq, 1, Allocated),
    {[Freq|Free],  NewAllocated}.

%% REVIEWER: Added an internal help function used to clear messages.
%% Note that this can be used by "anybody" (client, server, whomever).

clear() ->
    receive
	Msg ->					%If ANY message found,
	    ?debugFmt("~p~n",[Msg]),		% %No fun if we never see what we're clearing. But, only during debugging.
	    clear()				%discard and check again.
    after 0 ->					%If NO message found, time out immediately
	    ok					%then exit.
    end.

%% REVIEWER: Added internal help functions for echoing and sleeping.
%% Yes, they're just wrappers around BIFs.  I'm being pedantic.

echo(Msg) ->
    Msg.

sleep(N) ->
    ?debugMsg("I'm feeling very sleepy."),
    timer:sleep(N),
    ?debugMsg("I feel refreshed!").
