%% A palindrome checking server

%% The basic solution creates a server process for a particular client
%% Pid, and then waits for messages having the proper format,
%% returning the appropriate response.

server(Pid) ->
    receive
	{check,Msg} ->				%Check for a palindrome.

		   lists:flatten(

			    false -> " is not "
			end]))},

	_ ->					%Stop for ANY other message.
	    ok
    end.

%% The modified solution creates a server not tied to a particular
%% client, and then waits for messages having the proper format (which
%% now includes the client Pid), returning the appropriate response to
%% the client.  Note also that now a diagnostic message is written to
%% standard out indicating the client Pid.

%% The replicating server solution creates a server that proxies
%% messages to a list of servers in a "round-robin" fashion.  Note
%% that the proxy server is agnostic about the server protocol.  I.e.,
%% it just forwards messages to the servers, who must handle
%% communication back to the client themselves.  Note also that a
%% proxy server does not control the life-cycle of its proxied
%% servers.  I.e., they must be started before calling proxy/1, with
%% their Pids passed in in a list.  Likewise, the proxied servers must
%% be stopped independent of the proxying server.  However, given that
%% the proxy server is protocol-agnostic, if the proxied servers
%% support stopping themselves in their own protocol, then the stop
%% message CAN be sent through the proxy server, though whatever that
%% message is, it must be sent multiple times once for ever server.
%% In practice, it may be safer to stop the proxied servers directly.
