%% REVIEWER: Program a supervisor process that can be used to start

%% ################################################################################

%% REVIEWER: This instruction from FutureLearn is difficult to parse.
%% "Program a supervisor process that can be used to start the
%% supervisor"???  Huh???  Don't you mean, "Program a supervisor
%% process that can be used to start the worker"?  Anyway, that's what
%% I'm doing, with the worker process being the frequency server.

%% The supervisor follows the generic process skeleton:
%% 1. Entry-point is an initialize function (supervisor_init/0).
%% 2. Jump into the Receive/Evaluate loop (supervisor_loop/1).
%% 3. Receive/Evaluate loop handles various messages.
%% 4. Terminate if you get a stop message.

%% The specific parts of the supervisor are these.
%% 1. The supervisor_init/0 function sets up trap exits to convert signals to messages.
%% 2. It starts one worker process via the frequency server's own init/0 function (see above).
%% 3. It establishes a bi-directional link using spawn_link (could also be uni-directional with a monitor).
%% 4. The state managed by supervisor_loop/1 is just the Pid of the supervised worker.
%% 5. Handle 'EXIT' messages from dying workers by just respawning the worker.
%% 6. Note that there's just one worker.  Could be a list, but I just want to keep it simple for now.

%% NOTE: Communication is an open question. The lecture videos talked
%% about supervision purely in terms of life-cycle management, but
%% didn't say anything about communication patterns.  Do supervisors
%% proxy messages to their worker processes?  I'm sure they could, but
%% I don't know if that's typical.  I just chose not to address that
%% issue, for the sake of simplicity.  The one and only one worker
%% process gets registered into the process registry.  If it dies, a
%% new process is registered under the same name (the module name).
%% That preserves the functional API methods that we originally
%% defined above.

supervisor_init() -> 
    process_flag(trap_exit,true),		%Trap exits
    supervisor_loop().				%Jump into the loop

worker_init() ->				%Just a wrapper to the function above
    init().

supervisor_loop() ->
    Pid = spawn_link(?MODULE,worker_init,[]),
    register(?MODULE,Pid),			%We could register under anything, say, "worker"
    supervisor_loop(Pid).

supervisor_loop(Pid) -> 
    receive 
	{'EXIT',_SomePid,_Reason} -> 		%Oh nos!  Worker died!  Respawn!
	    NewPid = spawn_link(?MODULE,worker_init,[]),
	    register(?MODULE,NewPid),		%But, we want to preserve the allocate/deallocate functions way above.
	    supervisor_loop(Pid);
	{stop,From} -> 				%Our client wants us to stop.
	    exit(whereis(?MODULE),kill),		%Exterminate worker w/ extreme prejudice
	    From ! {reply,ok}			%Hey, Client, everything's A-OK!
